# work_logger
A tool to keep track of daily work logs

# Cloud storage
There is support only for S3 bucket storage. I created an S3 bucket using the following tutorial https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-upload-and-download-files-from-aws-s3-using-python-2022-4c9b787b15f2. Using the boto3 package, data is downloaded / uploaded from the S3 bucket.

# Credentials
The credentials are stored inside a credentials folder
